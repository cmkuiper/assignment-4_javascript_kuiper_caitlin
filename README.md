#### Comments
- It seems like we didn't receive instruction for several of the tasks we were asked to complete for this assignment. I had to refer to my notes from Advanced Web 1 often and rewatched the lectures from Richard, but I still didn't feel like I had the knowledge to confidently complete the tasks. Did we miss a more in-depth lecture about complex types?
